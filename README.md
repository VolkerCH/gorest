#GoRest

A RESTful style web-services framework for the Go language. Creating services in Go is straight forward, GoRest takes this a step further by adding a layer that makes tedious tasks much more automated and avoids regular pitfalls. This gives you the opportunity to focus more on the task at hand... minor low-level http handling.

Features:

- Type safe conversion of URL parameters into method arguments.
- Automated marshal/unmarshall of HTTP entities.
- Highly configurable end-point system that makes grouping of end-points into services easy.
- Tag(Annotations) based configuration of end-points and services.
- Easilly pluggable URL system to allow various multiplexing configurations.
- Configured as per "mostly accepted" RESTful style behaviour (e.g: behaviour of a POST or GET). Ability to overide the default behaviour.
- Many planned features coming soon.
